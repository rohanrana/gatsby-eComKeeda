A range of other new and existing investors, including Sequoia India, Partners of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/digital-sky-technologies-fo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DST Global,&nbsp;<strong></strong></a>&nbsp;Tencent, GGV Capital,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/ru-net-holdings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RTP Global,&nbsp;<strong></strong></a>&nbsp;Hummingbird Ventures, Falcon Edge Capital, Rocketship.vc and Unilever Ventures, also participated in the round, as did Facebook’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/kevin-weil\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kevin Weil,&nbsp;<strong></strong></a>&nbsp;Calm’s Alexander Will,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/india-cred-kunal-shah/\">CRED’s Kunal Shah</a>&nbsp;and Snapdeal co-founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one-and-a-half-year-old startup, which closed its Series A financing round in October last year and has raised $87 million to date, is now valued between $275 million to $300 million, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hundreds of millions of Indians came online in the last decade, but most merchants — think of neighborhood stores — are still offline in the country. They continue to rely on long notebooks to keep a log of their financial transactions. The process is also time-consuming and prone to errors, which could result in substantial losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/khatabook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Khatabook,&nbsp;<strong></strong></a>&nbsp;as well as a handful of young and established players in the country, is attempting to change that by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/30/khatabook-seriesa-businesses-bookkeeping-payments/\">using apps to allow merchants to digitize their bookkeeping and also accept payments</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today more than 8 million merchants from over 700 districts use Khatabook, its co-founder and chief executive Ravish Naresh told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We spent most of last year growing our user base,” said Naresh. And that bet has worked for Khatabook, which today competes with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-financial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lightspeed&nbsp;<strong></strong></a>-backed OkCredit, Ribbit Capital-backed BharatPe, Walmart’s PhonePe and Paytm, all of which have raised more money.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-1024x599.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16\" srcset=\"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-1024x599.jpg 1024w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-300x176.jpg 300w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-768x450.jpg 768w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-1200x702.jpg 1200w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n","featured_media":{"source_url":"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-463156832.jpg"},"categories":[{"name":"Technology"}],"excerpt":"<p>Khatabook,  a startup that is helping small businesses in India record financial transactions digitally and accept payments online with an app, has raised $60 million in a new financing round as it looks to gain more ground in the world’s second most populous nation.</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online"}}}
