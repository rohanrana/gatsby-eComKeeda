The 2021 Polestar 2 is the first EV to come out of Polestar since it was recast as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/volvos-polestar-is-now-its-own-company-focused-on-performance-evs/\">electric performance brand</a>&nbsp;in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has had plans to open physical retail showrooms called “Polestar Spaces.” Those plans have been delayed by stay-at-home orders prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The stores are expected to open in the second half of 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polestars plans to expand its retail footprint in the first half of 2021 with locations in Boston, Denver, Texas, Washington, D.C. and Florida. More than 80% of Polestar 2 reservation holders reside within a 150-mile range of the stores scheduled to open by mid 2021, according to Gregor Hembrough, head of Polestar USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the traditional dealership model, Polestar will sell or lease its cars online to customers in all 50 states. The physical stores, which will be in partnership with retailers such as Manhattan Motorcars, Galpin Motors and Price-Simms Automotive Group, are meant to supplement its digital strategy.</p>\n","featured_media":{"source_url":"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Polestar_Space_Oslo_002.jpg"},"categories":[{"name":"Technology"}],"excerpt":"<p>Polestar’s  first U.S. retail stores will open in Los Angeles, New York City and two locations in San Francisco later this year — the latest milestone for the automaker as it gets closer to bringing its all-electric vehicle to market.</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"polestar-to-open-first-us-stores-in-the-second-half-of-2020"}}}
