Loverro&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-administrator-selects-douglas-loverro-as-next-human-spaceflight-head\">came in as head of HEO in October</a>, following the reassignment last summer of Bill Gerstenmaier, who led it for many years and reportedly left after clashing with NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ken Bowersox, a NASA veteran who briefly served as acting administrator between the tenure of the two, will take over the role for the present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loverro was careful to tamp down any rumors of discord surrounding&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;resignation, though he did not get specific. In an ominous note reportedly sent to colleagues, he wrote:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The risks we take, whether technical, political, or personal, all have potential consequences if we judge them incorrectly. I took such a risk earlier in the year because I judged it necessary to fulfill our mission. Now, over the balance of time, it is clear that I made a mistake in that choice for which I alone must bear the consequences.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>What exactly that risk was is as yet unknown; there is no choice he made that has obviously gone sour in the last few days. Programs related to the Artemis mission, specifically the Space Launch System development process, have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/nasas-sls-moon-rocket-is-2-years-behind-and-billions-over-budget-internal-report-finds/\">received pointed criticism for overspending and delays</a>, but they predate Loverro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The immediate effect of Loverro’s departure is difficult to calculate. His immediate duties, including issuing final OKs for the upcoming Demo-2 mission putting two astronauts aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, will be fulfilled by Bowersox. Demo-2 is scheduled for a May 27 launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>this is the quote to highlight this blogs</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Test 1</li><li>Test 2</li><li>Test 3 </li><li>Test 4</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-1-1024x599.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"24\" data-full-url=\"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-1.jpg\" data-link=\"http://34.67.49.241/?attachment_id=24\" class=\"wp-image-24\" srcset=\"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-1-1024x599.jpg 1024w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-1-300x176.jpg 300w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-1-768x450.jpg 768w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-1-1200x702.jpg 1200w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/khatabook_team-1.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Polestar_Space_Oslo_002-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"25\" data-full-url=\"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Polestar_Space_Oslo_002-1.jpg\" data-link=\"http://34.67.49.241/?attachment_id=25\" class=\"wp-image-25\" srcset=\"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Polestar_Space_Oslo_002-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Polestar_Space_Oslo_002-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Polestar_Space_Oslo_002-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Polestar_Space_Oslo_002-1-1200x900.jpg 1200w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Polestar_Space_Oslo_002-1.jpg 1390w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/doug-loverro-1-1024x624.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"26\" data-full-url=\"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/doug-loverro-1.jpg\" data-link=\"http://34.67.49.241/?attachment_id=26\" class=\"wp-image-26\" srcset=\"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/doug-loverro-1-1024x624.jpg 1024w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/doug-loverro-1-300x183.jpg 300w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/doug-loverro-1-768x468.jpg 768w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/doug-loverro-1-1200x731.jpg 1200w, http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/doug-loverro-1.jpg 1390w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">NASA Associate Administrator for the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate Doug Loverro gives remarks on the agency’s Artemis program, Monday, Dec. 9, 2019, at NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans.
