The initiative piloted innovative ideas and filled critical knowledge gaps about malnutrition and food security. With support from the United Kingdom, Australia, and the European Commission, SAFANSI provided $24.2 million to finance more than 100 activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=SAFANSI+focused+on+improving+the+micro-+and+macro-nutrient+content+of+food+needed+for+good+health%2C+rather+than+sufficient+caloric+intake+alone.+&amp;url=https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/ensuring-food-security-and-nutrition-south-asia-during-covid-19/?cid=EXT_WBBlogTweetableShare_D_EXT&amp;via=WorldBankSAsia\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SAFANSI focused on improving the micro- and macro-nutrient content of food needed for good health, rather than sufficient caloric intake alone. &nbsp;</a>It examined reasons behind the region’s sharp disparities in the nutrition status of men and women. The program also developed packages of interventions to help poor households by combining expertise in agriculture, health, education, water supply, sanitation, and social safety nets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are some of SAFANSI’s findings that can help guide recovery efforts in South Asia over the coming months, especially for the vulnerable population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1</strong>. A SAFANSI-funded research study,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/31360\">The Nutrition Sensitivity of Food&nbsp;and Agriculture in South Asia</a>,&nbsp;identified a set of complex relationships underlying malnutrition.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Social+safety+nets%2C+including+food+transfer+programs%2C+can+help+the+most+vulnerable+households+cope+with+food+shortages+and+rising+prices%2C+though+transfers+may+be+too+small+to+support+long-term+improvements+in+nutrition+and+health.&amp;url=https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/ensuring-food-security-and-nutrition-south-asia-during-covid-19/?cid=EXT_WBBlogTweetableShare_D_EXT&amp;via=WorldBankSAsia\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Social safety nets, including food transfer programs, can help the most vulnerable households cope with food shortages and rising prices, though transfers may be too small to support long-term improvements in nutrition and health.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;Investments in home gardens and livestock can help households weather future crises by providing access to nutritious vegetables, eggs, and milk.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/users/user17091/shutterstock_1629253189_0.jpg\" alt=\"Photo: Jahangir Alam Onuchcha / Shutterstock.com\" title=\"Photo: Jahangir Alam Onuchcha / Shutterstock.com\"/><figcaption>Photo: Jahangir Alam Onuchcha / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Another study,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211912419300197\">The Cost of a Nutritious Diet in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka</a>, suggests that consumers in these countries should spend more of their food budget on perishables such as dairy and vegetables. The average household here consumes enough cereals and starchy staples but lacks a sufficient quantity of vegetables, which often have more variable prices.&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Trade+disruptions+related+to+COVID-19+are%26nbsp%3Bconstraining+supply+chains+and+could%26nbsp%3Blead+to+higher+prices+for+perishable+foods%2C+exacerbating+these+deficiencies.&amp;url=https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/ensuring-food-security-and-nutrition-south-asia-during-covid-19/?cid=EXT_WBBlogTweetableShare_D_EXT&amp;via=WorldBankSAsia\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trade disruptions related to COVID-19 are&nbsp;constraining supply chains and could&nbsp;lead to higher prices for perishable foods, exacerbating these deficiencies.&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;A further study,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/513231468101988482/pdf/710890ESW0P1270SDS0FINAL0ClearedMap.pdf\">Gender-Inclusive Nutrition Activities in South Asia</a>, examined why gender is a key factor in the region’s malnutrition rates.

After the central government delegated nutrition issues to provincial governments, SAFANSI helped develop&nbsp;<a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/125531534916897360/Guiding-Policy-and-Investment-in-Human-Nutrition-in-Four-Provinces-of-Pakistan\">nutrition policy guidance notes</a>&nbsp;in four provinces that stressed multisectoral coordination with a focus on water supply and hygiene, food security, health care services, girls’ education, and social safety nets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there has been progress, food security and malnutrition remain a huge challenge for&nbsp;South Asia.&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=+Hence+the+World+Bank+is+prioritizing+food+security+in+the+region%27s%26nbsp%3BCOVID-19+response.+&amp;url=https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/ensuring-food-security-and-nutrition-south-asia-during-covid-19/?cid=EXT_WBBlogTweetableShare_D_EXT&amp;via=WorldBankSAsia\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;Hence the World Bank is prioritizing food security in the region&#8217;s&nbsp;COVID-19 response. &nbsp;</a>This entails maintaining domestic production, keeping borders open, minimizing disruptions to supply chains, and strengthening global cooperation to secure food. It is also essential to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable and ensure that food is not only plentiful, but also nutritious. SAFANSI teaches a number of effective ways to do this such as focusing on nutrient-dense foods, combining social safety net programs with nutrition education, and tailoring interventions for pregnant and nursing women, young children, and adolescent females.</p>\n","featured_media":{"source_url":"http://34.67.49.241/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/heroshutterstock_1629251371.jpg"},"categories":[{"name":"Corona"}],"excerpt":"<p>When Anushree Shridhar heard that vegetables and fruits were rotting in fields near Bengaluru because of India’s COVID-19 lockdown, she knew she had to do something to connect farmers and hungry families.
